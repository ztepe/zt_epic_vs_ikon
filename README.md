## comparing the two major ski resort passes


The project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one-paragraph or longer description of what your project is about. Do not skip this.
Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project. This can be a requirements.txt, a config.py file, or just commands formatted neatly in markdown on your readme that say “pip install pandas” for example. But you have to specify which packages need to be installed. 
Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
Any special instructions are required for the reviewer to run your project. (For example: “run python main.py” from the command line)
Guide to using markdown for README.md files (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
Describe the data used in the analysis in the README file.


Using data of major US ski resorts, I am useing data to compare each resort as well as two different season passes to see which one has the most value.

Avg total annual snowfall (bar graph)
Number of runs (bar graph? )
Total distance of skiable terrain ()

Map resorts for both passes
